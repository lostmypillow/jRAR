# RAR Server
**Django** web app for Raspberry Pi | Arduino | RFID Project, complete with **Django Ninja** API backend, **SQLite** database and a **Vite(React)** frontend with MUI components

[Demo/Frontend](https://rarserver.lostmypillow.duckdns.org/)

Source code for frontend is located in the "/frontend" folder

[API Documentation](https://rarserver.lostmypillow.duckdns.org/api/docs)

Or alternatively pull my Docker image:

```bash
#ARM64 version
docker pull lostmypillow/jrar:1.0.0
```




## Why does the URL start with "rarserver"?
This project was named "rarserver" originally, when I separated backend and frontend, the NGINX proxy configs require me to manually update it if I were to change it to "jrar", I'll do that soon but not now


## Future for this Project

### Mobile App
I want an app for it

### Dark Mode
Self explanatory.
